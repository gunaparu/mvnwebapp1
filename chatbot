Cyera’s dashboard offers a unified, intuitive interface that enables organizations to identify, classify, and manage sensitive data across their cloud and on-prem environments. Designed as a single pane of glass, it provides a comprehensive view of all data assets, making it easy for security and compliance teams to quickly assess their data landscape. One of its standout features is its ability to prioritize risks, highlighting critical issues such as exposed personal identifiable information (PII), unencrypted data, and policy violations.

The dashboard’s drill-down capabilities allow users to dive into specific flagged data, enabling them to review associated files, metadata, and classifications for more detailed investigation. This is supported by Cyera’s automated classification engine, which categorizes sensitive data types such as credit card details, health records, and other regulatory-related information. The platform also supports collaborative workflows, enabling teams to annotate findings, mark potential false positives, and track remediation actions.

Through its combination of comprehensive visibility, automated insights, and actionable intelligence, Cyera’s dashboard empowers organizations to proactively manage sensitive data, reduce risk, and ensure compliance across all data stores.
