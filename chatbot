Subject: Request for Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan for Your Application

Dear [Product Owner’s Name],

I hope you are doing well.

As part of our disaster recovery (DR) preparedness efforts, we are gathering the DR plans for applications across our AWS accounts. We need to collect the DR plan for your application, [Application Name], and pass it to the Fusion team for documentation.

If you already have a DR plan in place, please share the latest version with me at your earliest convenience. If a DR plan has not been created yet, I kindly request you to initiate the process and provide the necessary details.

Please confirm the status of your application’s DR plan by [deadline, if applicable]. Let me know if you need any guidance or assistance.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
