Just checking in to kindly request an update on my earlier email regarding notice period buyout and early release.

As mentioned, my resignation was submitted on 20th May 2025, and I’ve completed close to one month of the 90-day notice period. I’m eager to proceed with the buyout option as per policy and would appreciate your guidance on the next steps and the payable amount, if approved.

Looking forward to your response at the earliest, as this will help me plan the transition accordingly.

Warm regards,
T. Gunasekhar
