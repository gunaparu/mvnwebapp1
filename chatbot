Slide 1: CloudGuardian — Introduction

What to Say:

	“Hey everyone, we’re excited to present CloudGuardian — an AI-powered solution designed to help security teams detect, analyze, and respond to threats in AWS environments faster and smarter.
In today’s dynamic cloud setups, security can’t rely on manual analysis or slow detection — so we built CloudGuardian to change that.”

Slide 2: Problem Statement

What to Say:

	“As a security team, we face millions of CloudTrail log entries daily. Manually analyzing these is time-consuming and error-prone.
The bigger issue? Critical threats often hide among benign logs, delaying detection and response.
Also, we use many AWS services — EC2, S3, RDS — but monitoring them in isolation means coordinated attacks could slip through unnoticed.
Finally, the lack of real-time, automated analysis makes it harder to act fast when something goes wrong.”

Slide 3: CloudGuardian Architecture

What to Say:

	“CloudGuardian addresses all these challenges with an AI-driven, automated, and scalable approach.
It continuously monitors CloudTrail logs and uses Bedrock’s Claude 3.5 model to score risks automatically.
If it detects abnormal patterns, like an unusual spike in API calls from an unknown IP, it flags them instantly.
High-risk events trigger real-time alerts via SNS, and all findings are stored in DynamoDB for audit and compliance.
It’s fully serverless — built on AWS Lambda, EventBridge, Bedrock, and QuickSight for a seamless, scalable experience.”

Slide 4: Solution – CloudGuardian

What to Say:

	“To sum it up, CloudGuardian automates threat detection using AI, ensures real-time alerts, scales effortlessly thanks to its serverless design, and stores every action for audits and compliance.
It’s designed to reduce manual effort, prioritize threats smartly, and speed up response time.”
