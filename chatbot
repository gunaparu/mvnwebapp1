Subject: Review and Removal of Inactive 3rd Party Service Roles in AIS Accounts

Hi [Recipientâ€™s Name],

We have received a list of inactive third-party service roles from the EGSO team. Please refer to the attached document for the IAM roles associated with AIS accounts.

If these roles are no longer required, kindly review and proceed with their removal on a high-priority basis to maintain optimal security and access management.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please let us know if any further information is needed.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
