KT on Risk Register – Session Notes (30 mins)
1. Introduction (2–3 mins)
•	Briefly introduce the purpose of the session.
•	“Today I’ll walk you through how we manage the Risk Register—what it’s for, how risks are added and tracked, and the approval and closure process.”
2. What is the Risk Register? (5 mins)
•	A centralized tracker for documenting and managing security-related risks.
•	Helps ensure visibility, ownership, and timely resolution of open risks.
•	Used by various teams to collaborate and monitor ongoing risk mitigation.
3. Process of Adding a Risk (7–8 mins)
•	Risks are typically reviewed and approved by Sai or Ram.
•	Each approved risk is assigned a specific tenure (duration for mitigation).
•	Once approved:
o	I document the risk in the Risk Register with relevant details like description, impact, owner, and timeline.
o	Teams involved are informed of their responsibilities regarding mitigation.
✅ You can show a real or dummy entry in the Risk Register here.
4. Tracking and Follow-up (7–8 mins)
•	As the risk’s timeline approaches:
o	I reach out to the respective team for the latest status update.
o	If the risk is resolved, it gets closed in the register with proper remarks.
o	If not resolved:
	The team must request additional time and seek fresh approval from Sai or Ram.
	Upon reapproval, the new tenure and remarks are updated accordingly.
🎯 Emphasize the need for proactive communication so risks don’t linger without visibility.
5. Governance and Accountability (3–4 mins)
•	Risk owners are accountable for timely mitigation.
•	Regular reviews help avoid escalations and ensure compliance readiness.
•	Register acts as an audit-friendly artifact for security tracking.
6. Q&A and Wrap-up (3–5 mins)
