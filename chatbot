Hi Ram,

I truly appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today and letting me know that my last working day is set as 4th July 2025.

With due respect, I would like to make a sincere and heartfelt request to consider relieving me earlier—by 26th June 2025.

Over the past week, I’ve tried to reach out several times through messages and emails to understand my relieving date, but unfortunately didn’t receive a response. The prolonged uncertainty took a toll on my mental peace and personal well-being. The pressure and silence left me anxious, sleepless, and emotionally distressed. I also lost a few important career opportunities because I couldn’t provide a clear timeline to the new employers.

This has been extremely hard for me—especially because I’ve always felt a deep sense of belonging and comfort working with you and this team. I never imagined I would be ending this journey on such a difficult emotional note.

I assure you, Ram, that I will ensure a complete and proper handover of all responsibilities before my exit. I genuinely need this early relieving not just for professional reasons, but also to regain my mental and emotional balance.

I hope you’ll understand the intensity of what I’m going through and support me in this request. Your approval would mean a great deal to me, more than I can express in words.

Looking forward to your kind consideration and support.

Warm regards,
T. Gunasekhar

Hi Ram,

I truly appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today and letting me know that my last working day is set as 4th July 2025.

With due respect, I would like to make a sincere and heartfelt request to kindly consider relieving me earlier—by 26th June 2025.

From the very first day of my resignation, I have been consistently requesting to proceed with the notice period buyout option. Unfortunately, despite multiple follow-ups, there has been no clarity or progress on it. Because of these ongoing uncertainties and lack of communication, I’ve found myself mentally overwhelmed and emotionally exhausted. The stress has not only affected my career progression—causing me to miss important opportunities—but has also deeply impacted my personal peace and well-being.

What pains me more is that I’ve always felt truly comfortable and connected with this team. I never imagined my journey here would end in such emotional distress. It’s been difficult to manage the silence around such a critical decision, and I’m genuinely struggling under the weight of this ambiguity.

I assure you that I will ensure a complete and smooth handover of my responsibilities before exit and will support the team in every possible way during this transition.

Please, Ram, I humbly seek your support and understanding at this point in my life. Your approval for an early release by 26th June 2025 would give me the space to restore my mental balance and move forward with clarity.

Looking forward to your kind response and support.

Warm regards,
T. Gunasekhar
