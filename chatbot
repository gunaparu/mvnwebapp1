Subject: Thank You All – Farewell from Experian

Hi Team,

As I wrap up my journey with Experian, I wanted to take a moment to extend my heartfelt thanks to each one of you for your constant support, collaboration, and encouragement throughout my time here.

Working alongside such a talented and supportive team has been a truly enriching experience. I’ve learned so much—not just technically, but also about teamwork, ownership, and professionalism—and I’ll always carry those learnings forward with pride.

A special thanks to Ram, for his guidance and support throughout my tenure, and especially during the exit process. Your leadership and patience have made a significant impact on my journey, and I’m sincerely grateful for all your help.

While I may be moving on to a new chapter, the time spent here will always remain close to my heart. I feel truly fortunate to have been part of such a wonderful team.

Please do stay in touch. Wishing you all continued success and growth, both personally and professionally.

Warm regards,
T. Gunasekhar
