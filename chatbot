Hi Ram,

I truly appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today and letting me know that my last working day is set as 4th July 2025.

With due respect, I would like to make a sincere and heartfelt request to consider relieving me earlier—by 26th June 2025.

Over the past week, I’ve tried to reach out several times through messages and emails to understand my relieving date, but unfortunately didn’t receive a response. The prolonged uncertainty took a toll on my mental peace and personal well-being. The pressure and silence left me anxious, sleepless, and emotionally distressed. I also lost a few important career opportunities because I couldn’t provide a clear timeline to the new employers.

This has been extremely hard for me—especially because I’ve always felt a deep sense of belonging and comfort working with you and this team. I never imagined I would be ending this journey on such a difficult emotional note.

I assure you, Ram, that I will ensure a complete and proper handover of all responsibilities before my exit. I genuinely need this early relieving not just for professional reasons, but also to regain my mental and emotional balance.

I hope you’ll understand the intensity of what I’m going through and support me in this request. Your approval would mean a great deal to me, more than I can express in words.

Looking forward to your kind consideration and support.

Warm regards,
T. Gunasekhar
