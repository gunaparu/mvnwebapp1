Hi Team,

As I move on from Experian, I wanted to take a moment to sincerely thank the Platform Engineering team for the support, collaboration, and encouragement extended to me during my time here.

It has been a great experience working with all of you, and I’ve truly enjoyed the opportunity to learn and contribute alongside such a skilled and dedicated group.

I would especially like to thank Hari Kadavergu for his continuous guidance and support. Hari, your patience, technical insights, and willingness to help whenever I reached out made a big difference in my learning and growth. I’m truly grateful for all the help you’ve given me.

Wishing you all continued success, and I hope our paths cross again in the future. Please do stay in touch.

Warm regards,
