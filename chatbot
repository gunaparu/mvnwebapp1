Dear ,

Thank you so much for your kind response and for confirming my last working day as 27th June 2025, exactly as requested. I sincerely appreciate your understanding and support in facilitating this early release.

I will ensure a smooth and complete handover with Ram, with all required documentation and information stored centrally as advised. I’ll also coordinate with HR for the remaining formalities to ensure everything is wrapped up seamlessly.

It’s been a privilege to be part of this team, and I truly value the experience and guidance I’ve received. Though our interactions were brief, your support at this crucial time means a great deal to me.

Thanks again for everything. I’ll definitely stay in touch.

Warm regards,
T. Gunasekhar
