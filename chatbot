1. Redundant Policies
	•	Multiple SCPs with overlapping rules across accounts
	•	Increases complexity and policy maintenance effort

2. Unattached SCPs
	•	SCPs exist but are not attached to root or member accounts
	•	These policies are ineffective and unused

3. Overly Permissive Access
	•	Some SCPs allow broad access (e.g., "Action": "*"), violating least privilege principle
	•	Risk of privilege misuse or lateral movement

4. Missing Explicit Deny for Sensitive Services
	•	No restrictions on critical services like IAM, KMS, or Organizations
	•	Increases risk of accidental or unauthorized changes

5. Misaligned Deployment Scope
	•	SCPs applied at root level with rules only relevant to a few accounts
	•	Causes unnecessary restrictions across the org

6. Inconsistent Naming Conventions
	•	No standard format for policy names or descriptions
	•	Makes it difficult to identify policy purpose or owner

7. Lack of Documentation & Versioning
	•	No version history or documentation of policy changes
	•	Hinders audit readiness and rollback capabilities

8. No Pre-Deployment Simulation
	•	SCP changes not tested using IAM policy simulator
	•	Increases risk of breaking workloads or access controls

9. Scattered Deployment Instead of OU-based
	•	SCPs attached to individual accounts rather than OUs
	•	Reduces scalability and operational efficiency

10. Excessive Use of Complex Conditions
	•	Complicated Condition blocks without validation
	•	Leads to unintended access denials and debugging challenges


1. Consolidate Redundant Policies
	•	Merge similar SCPs to reduce clutter and simplify management
	•	Use modular design for better scalability and clarity

2. Review and Attach All Relevant SCPs
	•	Audit for unattached SCPs and remove or attach as needed
	•	Ensure all active policies serve a valid control purpose

3. Enforce Least Privilege with Explicit Denies
	•	Apply Explicit Deny for high-risk services (IAM, KMS, Organizations)
	•	Avoid wildcard actions ("Action": "*") unless strictly necessary

4. Align SCPs with Organizational Units (OUs)
	•	Attach policies to OUs instead of individual accounts
	•	Simplifies policy enforcement and centralizes management

5. Standardize Naming & Descriptions
	•	Follow consistent naming conventions for easier identification
	•	Include purpose and scope in descriptions or tags

6. Implement Change Tracking & Documentation
	•	Maintain version-controlled documentation for every SCP
	•	Track policy owners, change history, and business justification

7. Use Policy Simulator for Testing
	•	Validate policy changes using IAM Policy Simulator or aws policytool
	•	Prevent accidental access disruption before deployment

8. Simplify Conditions
	•	Refactor complex Condition blocks for clarity
	•	Test with real-world scenarios to ensure expected behavior

9. Review SCPs Quarterly
	•	Schedule regular reviews for all SCPs with stakeholders
	•	Align with business changes, compliance requirements, and security goals

10. Integrate with Security Automation
	•	Use AWS Config or custom Lambda functions to flag policy drift
	•	Set up alerts for policy changes or detachment events

Here’s a professional set of presentation notes to go along with each slide for your SCP Analysis deck. You can use this script during your presentation or include it in speaker notes.

Slide 1: SCP Analysis

Speaker Notes:

In this analysis, we reviewed all Service Control Policies (SCPs) currently in place across our AWS Organization. The objective was to identify inefficiencies, inconsistencies, and risks that could impact our cloud governance and security posture. We examined attachment status, policy content, naming conventions, and alignment with organizational units (OUs).

⸻

Slide 2: Identified Issues

Speaker Notes:

During the analysis, several key issues emerged:

	•	Unattached SCPs: 5 SCPs were found unattached—these have no effect and could be deprecated or evaluated for reuse.
	•	Redundant Permissions: Multiple SCPs include overlapping statements, leading to maintenance complexity.
	•	Misaligned Deployment Scope: SCPs are inconsistently applied across accounts instead of using logical OU-level targeting.
	•	Inconsistent Naming Conventions: SCP names vary in format, making it harder to identify their purpose at a glance.
	•	Lack of Documentation & Versioning: Policies lack proper descriptions and version tracking, affecting traceability.
	•	No Pre-Deployment Simulation: Changes are not tested in sandbox environments, increasing risk of disruptions.
	•	Scattered Deployments: SCPs are often attached directly to accounts rather than being centrally managed via OUs.

⸻

Slide 3: Analyzed Data Summary

Speaker Notes:

Here’s the quantitative summary of our analysis:

	•	A total of 25 SCPs were reviewed.
	•	Only 3 SCPs are attached at the root level, suggesting minimal enforcement from the top level.
	•	5 SCPs are completely unattached, providing no governance benefit.
	•	19 SCPs show potential for policy merging, where similar permissions can be combined into more efficient and manageable policies.

⸻

Slide 4: Recommendations

Speaker Notes:

Based on our findings, here are the key recommendations:

	•	Consolidate Redundant Policies to simplify governance.
	•	Review and Attach Relevant SCPs to ensure policies are active and effective.
	•	Align SCPs with OUs instead of direct account-level attachments to streamline enforcement.
	•	Standardize Naming & Descriptions for clarity and ease of use.
	•	Implement Change Tracking & Documentation to record policy history and changes.
	•	Review SCPs Quarterly to keep them relevant as environments evolve.
	•	Integrate with Security Automation tools to catch misconfigurations early.

⸻

Slide 5: Action Plan / Roadmap

Speaker Notes:

Here’s a phased roadmap to operationalize the recommendations:

	•	Immediate Action: Identify and remove or reassign unattached SCPs.
	•	Short-Term Goals: Implement a naming standard and add meaningful descriptions for all SCPs.
	•	Medium-Term Goals: Merge redundant policies and restructure deployments to align with OUs.
	•	Long-Term Goals: Automate SCP compliance checks, simulate changes before deployment, and embed reviews into the security lifecycle.

Slide 6: Thank You!

Speaker Notes:

Thank you for your time. I’m happy to discuss any part of the analysis or the recommendations in more detail. Your feedback and collaboration will help us strengthen cloud governance going forward.
