Subject: Heartfelt Thanks for Your Support and Guidance

Hi Sai,

I wanted to take a moment to sincerely thank you for everything you’ve done for me—right from the beginning of my journey at Experian to now, as I move on to the next chapter.

When I joined the team, I didn’t have prior experience, but you still gave me an opportunity and trusted me with responsibilities. That belief truly meant a lot and has played a big role in shaping my career and confidence. I’ll always be grateful for that chance.

I also want to thank you for the support and understanding you’ve shown throughout my exit process. Your patience and guidance, especially during uncertain and emotionally difficult moments, made a big difference to me. I genuinely appreciate your kindness and the way you handled everything with professionalism and empathy.

Please know that I’ll always carry a deep sense of respect and gratitude for your mentorship. I feel fortunate to have worked under your leadership, and I’ll always look back on this experience with appreciation.

Wishing you continued success in all that you do. I hope we stay in touch.

Warm regards,
T. Gunasekhar
