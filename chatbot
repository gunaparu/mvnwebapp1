Dear Ram,
Cc: [HR’s Name] / HR Team

I hope you’re doing well.

Following my resignation submitted on 20th May 2025, and as per the terms of my employment contract, I am writing to formally request an early release through notice period buyout.

As mentioned in my offer letter, I understand that either party may opt for a notice period buyout equivalent to the base salary for the unserved duration. I have already served nearly 30 days of the 90-day notice period, and I kindly request to be relieved by 20th June 2025, by compensating for the remaining period as per company policy.

I would appreciate your urgent support and HR’s guidance on the buyout amount and next steps. I am committed to ensuring a complete and smooth handover before my departure.

Thank you very much for your understanding.

Warm regards,
T. Gunasekhar
