Dear Wendy and Sai,

I hope you’re doing well.

Following up on the recent discussions and Savitha’s guidance to coordinate with you both, I would like to sincerely request your support in approving my early release by 26th June 2025, through the notice period buyout process.

To share a bit of context, I submitted my resignation on 20th May 2025 and from the very beginning, I have been actively requesting for early relieving or the possibility of a buyout—well before even submitting my resignation. I also reached out to HR (Savitha) early on to seek clarity, but unfortunately, I did not receive specific guidance or confirmation regarding the buyout procedure.

Over the past few weeks, I have made every effort to follow the right process, seeking confirmation on my last working day in order to plan ahead. However, the lack of timely clarity has caused significant emotional strain and impacted my mental peace, along with causing me to miss time-sensitive career opportunities. My intention in expressing this is not to shift blame, but to transparently share the toll the uncertainty has taken on my well-being.

I’ve always had a very positive and meaningful experience with the team, and this makes the current situation even harder for me personally. I assure you that I will complete a thorough and responsible handover to ensure a smooth transition without any disruption to the team’s operations.

I kindly request your consideration and support in approving my early relieving date as 26th June 2025, along with guidance on the next steps and the payable buyout amount, if applicable.

Thank you both for your time, understanding, and support. Please let me know if there’s anything else needed from my side to help move this forward.

Warm regards,
T Gunasekhar.
