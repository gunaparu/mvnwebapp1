DSPM PoC Report

Introduction:
Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) is a technology used to help our organization protect sensitive data. It continuously monitors data environments to detect anomalous behavior and security risks. FSD onboarded the following three accounts to validate the product’s capabilities and test the use cases provided by GSO:

	•	EXPN-NA-CIS-ADS-NenPred (148831404783)
	•	EXPN-NA-CIS-Ascend-Experience-NenPred (887439093500)
	•	EXPN-NA-CIS-AcceleratorARRs-NenPred (529330437651)

The list of use cases tested and the scoring matrix are included in the report.

Products selected for DSPM PoC:

	•	Wiz
	•	Cyera

Findings:

Wiz:

	•	Wiz provides a single-pane dashboard that displays findings and issues that have been identified. These issues are categorized based on severity, ranging from critical to high, medium, and low. This categorization helps prioritize findings based on the type and nature of the data.
	•	Wiz can classify data by recognizing data types such as Digital Identity, Financial, Data Lineage, PHI, PII, and other sensitive information.
	•	Wiz allows for the creation of custom rules to detect findings or issues. These rules can be used to monitor activity and send alerts when triggered.
	•	Wiz has the capability to auto-remediate issues using custom rules.
	•	Wiz integrates with all enterprise tools, enhancing its compatibility across different environments.
	•	Wiz provides graphical visualizations and allows for drill-downs to obtain precise information on each finding or issue (see Fig 1).

Challenges:

Wiz:

	•	The team has observed that some critical or sensitive findings identified by Cyera are also reported in Wiz, but certain findings captured by Cyera are not detected by Wiz.
	•	KMS keys need to be provided as part of Wiz’s data scanning process, whereas in Cyera, this setup is not required.
	•	Wiz uses random sampling to scan and report data, which may lead to missing some critical findings and issues.

Cyera:

	•	Auto-remediation is possible with Cyera, but it still requires integration with another application (e.g., Tines) to function effectively.
	•	Real-time alerting is not available in Cyera. If real-time alerts are needed, integration with tools like Splunk is required.
	•	Graphical visualization of the reported issues is lacking in Cyera.
