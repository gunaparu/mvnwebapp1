1. Redundant Policies
	•	Multiple SCPs with overlapping rules across accounts
	•	Increases complexity and policy maintenance effort

2. Unattached SCPs
	•	SCPs exist but are not attached to root or member accounts
	•	These policies are ineffective and unused

3. Overly Permissive Access
	•	Some SCPs allow broad access (e.g., "Action": "*"), violating least privilege principle
	•	Risk of privilege misuse or lateral movement

4. Missing Explicit Deny for Sensitive Services
	•	No restrictions on critical services like IAM, KMS, or Organizations
	•	Increases risk of accidental or unauthorized changes

5. Misaligned Deployment Scope
	•	SCPs applied at root level with rules only relevant to a few accounts
	•	Causes unnecessary restrictions across the org

6. Inconsistent Naming Conventions
	•	No standard format for policy names or descriptions
	•	Makes it difficult to identify policy purpose or owner

7. Lack of Documentation & Versioning
	•	No version history or documentation of policy changes
	•	Hinders audit readiness and rollback capabilities

8. No Pre-Deployment Simulation
	•	SCP changes not tested using IAM policy simulator
	•	Increases risk of breaking workloads or access controls

9. Scattered Deployment Instead of OU-based
	•	SCPs attached to individual accounts rather than OUs
	•	Reduces scalability and operational efficiency

10. Excessive Use of Complex Conditions
	•	Complicated Condition blocks without validation
	•	Leads to unintended access denials and debugging challenges
