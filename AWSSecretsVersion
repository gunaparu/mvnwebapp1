How does AWS Secrets Manager Versioning work?
AWS Secrets Manager Versioning is a powerful tool that allows you to manage multiple versions of your secrets. Each version is assigned a unique identifier, which can be used to retrieve the secret when needed. One of the key features of AWS Secrets Manager Versioning is the use of version stages. Version stages allow you to designate certain versions as 'current' or 'previous', making it easy to keep track of which version is being used in production and which version is being phased out.
Another important feature of AWS Secrets Manager Versioning is the use of version labels. Version labels are user-defined tags that can be used to provide additional context about each version. For example, you might use a version label to indicate which application or environment the secret is associated with. This makes it easier to manage your secrets and ensures that they are always used in the appropriate context.
