Cloud environments face significant challenges in security monitoring and threat detection within AWS. With the vast volume of CloudTrail logs generated daily, identifying and prioritizing high-risk activities becomes a complex task. Traditional approaches often rely on manual analysis or static rules, making them inefficient in detecting sophisticated threats. Additionally, existing solutions may lack automated contextual analysis, making it difficult to assess potential risks across various AWS services, such as IAM, EC2, S3, Lambda, and RDS. This gap increases the risk of undetected misconfigurations, unauthorized access, privilege escalations, and anomalous activities, potentially leading to security breaches.


Our solution, CloudGuardian, leverages AWS Bedrockâ€™s AI capabilities to automate security analysis of CloudTrail logs, identifying high-risk activities across AWS services. It uses AI-driven risk assessment to detect anomalies, privilege escalations, and misconfigurations, providing actionable insights. Additionally, it integrates with AWS SNS for real-time alerts, ensuring proactive threat mitigation.
