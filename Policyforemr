Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to inform you of my intention to take leave from [Start Date] to [End Date]. During this time, I plan to undergo Ayurvedic treatment for migraine headaches, which I believe will significantly improve my health and well-being.

I have ensured that all pending tasks and responsibilities are either completed or delegated appropriately to ensure a smooth workflow during my absence. Additionally, I will be available via email or phone for any urgent matters that may arise during my leave.

I kindly request your approval for this leave and would appreciate it if you could confirm your acceptance at your earliest convenience. If there are any forms or procedures I need to follow to formalize this request, please let me know, and I will promptly attend to them.

Thank you for your understanding and support in this matter. I am confident that this brief period of leave will allow me to return to work refreshed and ready to contribute effectively to our team.

Warm regards,

[Your Name]
