1. Cloud Security & AWS Security Best Practices

Q1: How have you implemented IAM policy design and role-based access control (RBAC) in AWS?

Answer:
	•	I follow the principle of least privilege (PoLP) when designing IAM policies.
	•	I use IAM roles instead of IAM users for access control, reducing credential sprawl.
	•	I define RBAC using IAM groups, roles, and policies to restrict permissions based on job functions.
	•	I use IAM Access Analyzer to detect excessive privileges.
	•	Example: In a previous role, I designed scoped-down IAM roles for DevOps engineers, limiting access to only the required EC2, S3, and RDS instances.

⸻

Q2: How do you automate IAM user, role, and group management using AWS CloudFormation and CLI?

Answer:
	•	I use CloudFormation templates to provision and manage IAM users, roles, and policies.
	•	I automate role creation using Boto3 scripts in Python.
	•	I integrate IAM role automation in CI/CD pipelines for consistent IAM enforcement.
	•	Example: I developed a CloudFormation-based IAM automation that provisions role-based access with least privilege policies, reducing manual intervention by 80%.

⸻

Q3: How do you handle AWS KMS key management and rotation securely?

Answer:
	•	Enable automatic key rotation for AWS-managed KMS keys.
	•	Restrict key access using KMS key policies and IAM policies.
	•	Use CloudTrail logs to monitor key usage and detect anomalies.
	•	Implement dual control for key deletion (disable before deletion).
	•	Example: I configured KMS multi-region keys for a disaster recovery setup, ensuring key availability across AWS regions.

⸻

Q4: How do you secure AWS CloudTrail logs to ensure integrity and prevent tampering?

Answer:
	•	Enable CloudTrail log file validation to detect tampering.
	•	Store logs in an S3 bucket with MFA Delete and versioning enabled.
	•	Implement AWS Security Hub and GuardDuty to monitor suspicious activities.
	•	Example: I set up a real-time CloudTrail event monitoring system using EventBridge + Lambda to detect unauthorized API calls.

2. DevSecOps, Automation & Security Posture Management

Q5: How do you automate cloud security misconfiguration detection and remediation using Python and AWS Config?

Answer:
	•	Use AWS Config rules to monitor security compliance.
	•	Automate misconfiguration remediation with Lambda functions triggered by AWS Config changes.
	•	Use Boto3 scripts to scan security misconfigurations and apply fixes.
	•	Example: I implemented an AWS Config-based compliance system that automatically blocks public S3 buckets, preventing accidental data exposure.

⸻

Q6: How do you automate security audits for AWS infrastructure?

Answer:
	•	I use AWS Security Hub and Inspector for vulnerability scanning.
	•	Implement Boto3 scripts that extract security findings and generate compliance reports.
	•	Use AWS Lambda to trigger remediation actions based on audit findings.
	•	Example: I built an automated audit pipeline that scans AWS accounts for IAM misconfigurations, reducing audit review time by 70%.

3. Threat Detection & Incident Response

Q7: How does your AWS Bedrock implementation work for CloudTrail event risk assessment?

Answer:
	•	I use Bedrock models to analyze CloudTrail logs for high-risk events.
	•	Bedrock classifies CloudTrail events into Critical, High, Medium, or Low risk.
	•	If Critical or High risk, an SNS notification alerts the security team for immediate action.
	•	Example: This system helped detect unusual API activity, preventing potential unauthorized access in real time.

⸻

Q8: How do you automatically detect risky AWS CloudTrail events and alert the security team?

Answer:
	•	Enable AWS GuardDuty and Security Hub for anomaly detection.
	•	Set up EventBridge rules to trigger AWS Lambda when a suspicious event occurs.
	•	Use AWS SNS to send real-time alerts to security teams.
	•	Example: I built a Lambda-based alerting system that detects unauthorized IAM role assumption attempts and automatically disables the role.

Q9: How do you investigate and mitigate security incidents in AWS?

Answer:
	•	Step 1: Detection – Use CloudTrail logs, GuardDuty, and VPC Flow Logs.
	•	Step 2: Containment – Revoke compromised IAM credentials, isolate affected instances.
	•	Step 3: Investigation – Analyze logs for root cause.
	•	Step 4: Remediation – Patch vulnerabilities, strengthen IAM policies.
	•	Step 5: Lessons Learned – Update security controls to prevent future incidents.
	•	Example: I handled an EC2 compromise incident, identified an exposed SSH key, and mitigated it by enforcing IAM-based SSH access.

4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) & DevOps Security

Q10: How do you integrate security into Terraform-based deployments?

Answer:
	•	Use Terraform modules with built-in security controls.
	•	Implement tfsec, Checkov to scan Terraform code for misconfigurations.
	•	Enforce least privilege IAM roles in Terraform scripts.
	•	Example: I integrated Terraform security scanning into GitHub Actions, blocking deployments with security violations.

⸻

Q11: What security challenges have you faced when managing Terraform state files, and how did you mitigate them?

Answer:
	•	Challenges: State files store sensitive data (IAM roles, passwords).
	•	Mitigation:
	•	Store state files in S3 with SSE-KMS encryption.
	•	Enable versioning and MFA Delete on S3.
	•	Use Terraform remote backend instead of local storage.

5. Web Application Security & Network Security

Q12: How do you configure AWS WAF to block OWASP Top 10 threats?

Answer:
	•	Use AWS Managed WAF rules for SQLi, XSS, and bot protection.
	•	Configure rate-based rules to block excessive requests.
	•	Deploy Geo-restriction rules to block traffic from high-risk countries.

⸻

Q13: What’s your approach to DDoS protection for AWS-hosted applications?

Answer:
	•	Enable AWS Shield Advanced for automatic DDoS mitigation.
	•	Use CloudFront + WAF for rate limiting and filtering.
	•	Implement auto-scaling to absorb traffic spikes.

6. Compliance & Regulatory Frameworks

Q14: How do you help organizations maintain compliance with ISO 27001, PCI DSS, or SOC 2 in AWS?

Answer:
	•	Use AWS Config, Security Hub for continuous compliance monitoring.
	•	Automate compliance checks with AWS Lambda-based audits.
	•	Implement encryption (KMS) and logging (CloudTrail) to meet regulatory needs.

7. Behavioral & Scenario-Based Questions

Q15: Tell me about a time when you identified a critical security risk in AWS—how did you fix it?

Answer:
	•	Situation: Detected an over-privileged IAM role with full access to an AWS account.
	•	Task: Needed to reduce the risk without disrupting production.
	•	Action: Used IAM Access Analyzer to review permissions, removed unnecessary privileges, and implemented role assumption instead of direct user access.
	•	Result: Reduced attack surface by 90% and prevented potential privilege escalation.
